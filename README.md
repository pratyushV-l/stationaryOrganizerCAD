# stationaryOrganizerCAD
i want to make a stationary organizer, that is compact, yet utilizable purely out of cardboard. This will need a unique custom design, which is why I am 3d modelling it using CAD, allowing me to explore the idea!!!

## Some Background...
I have always wanted to try CAD, but have never really been able to design anything beyond the utmost basics(making a cude in TinkerCAD). I really wanted to explore this field, but never realized AutoCAD, provided that opputionity to students for free until recently. This lead me to trying AutoCAD fusion 360, and what better object to model, than a solution to a real life issue. This is what caused me to make a stationary organizer.
