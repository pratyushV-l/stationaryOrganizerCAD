# stationaryOrganizerCAD
i want to make a stationary organizer, that is compact, yet utilizable purely out of cardboard. This will need a unique custom design, which is why I am 3d modelling it using CAD, allowing me to explore the idea!!! See the project at - https://www.tinkercad.com/things/j7T1EEIXgMB-magnificent-bombul-esboo/edit?sharecode=vd4Wl7wbjHPQO1VODKUiJaG2eFshGIM5VhZLdxaiAhs

Before I show you the project though, I want to talk a bit about the design process, as I found it particularly interesting. During the making of this 3d model, I faced a lot of issues, mainly due to lack of knowledge, but what truly helped me solve this problem was the community. I felt this to be an encouraging factor, as it really proved to me that no matter what you face, there will be a community to back you up(which is also what HackClub is doing for me)

## Some Background...
I have always wanted to try CAD, but have never really been able to design anything beyond the utmost basics(making a cude in TinkerCAD). I really wanted to explore this field, but never realized AutoCAD, provided that opputionity to students for free until recently. This lead me to trying AutoCAD fusion 360, and what better object to model, than a solution to a real life issue. This is what caused me to make a stationary organizer.
